FoodFrenzy! is a fullstack application that I made using MERN!

To get started, download both the backend and frontend folders. Open each 
folder in a separate terminal, and run "npm install" to download the necessary files.

After doing that, make sure to create an API key using Google Maps JS SDK API as well as Google Maps geocoding API (both free to do).

Insert the SDK API key into index.html (located in the frontend folder) on line 29 in the script tag.

Insert the Geocoding API Key in the location.js (located in the backend folder) on line 13. After that, comment out the dummy coordinates in that same file
(lines 12-16).

Finally, create a MongoDB cluster and insert the connection string to the database in the app.js file within the backend folder on line 48.

After doing these steps, you should be ready to run the app!

In each terminal you have opened, run the command "npm start" to run both the backend and frontend parts of the program. The program should
automatically open in your browser.

Enjoy!
